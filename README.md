# PowerUpLibraries

This repository contains the libraries needed by the Robot controller java code on Windows and Mac platforms.

Download the *.jar and *.so files from Windows/ or Mac/ subdirectories into [home-directory]/wpilib/user/java/lib/.

You will have to restart Eclipse after downloading the libraries for them to show up in the Project's Referenced Libraries.
